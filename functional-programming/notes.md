# Functional Programming

## Immutability

The concept whereby the state of an object cannot be modified after it has been created. One convention when dealing with immutability is to create a copy of the object and make modifications to it, rather than altering the original object.

In Functional Programming, a function with the same input should always return the same result. This is the concept of Pure Functions.
