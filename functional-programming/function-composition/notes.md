# Functional Programming

## Function Composition

A series or a chaining of functions. The process where the return value of one function is passed as an argument into another function. Say we have two functions, both which accept the parameter x, f(x) and g(x), the return value of the function g is passed as an argument into function f, i.e. f(g(x));
